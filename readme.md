This project should provide a easy startingpoint and overview on how to use greatexpectations with pandas dataframes.

# Setup
The easiest way to run this notebook is through google colab with the following link (make sure to follow the steps of uploading the two csv files): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14cedVlaf4i8Atmdhoa-7QtDOMhlUY9zz?usp=sharing


Alternatively, you need to have an installation of python with the package greatexpectations installed. To install greatexpectations, please follow this guide: https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/setup/installation/local/

# Data
The csv files in this project were freely extracted from https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/archive/export/basel_switzerland_2661604 through the demo access. I changed soome formatting and column names to better fit this project.
